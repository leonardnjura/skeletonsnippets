What?

It's okay. "You should use Skeleton if you're embarking on a smaller project or just don't feel like you need all the utility of larger frameworks" - [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/)
<br />

Skeleton Snippets extension will generate a html template including CDN for Skeleton CSS, Font Awesome and a light Google font shown below. To generate start typing `!skele` and hit your return key<br />

To use the Google font family included, create a css directory and inside the css file referenced include: 
```
.lyte {
  font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;
}

.theme {
  color: #00ccff;
}
```

Customize as desired, :)
